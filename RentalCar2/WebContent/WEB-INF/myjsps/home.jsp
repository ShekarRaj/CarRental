    <p><font size="3">America has long been a country fueled by the idea of travel. All elements of United States history seem to involve some degree of exploration, and each of the four distinct regions within the country are home to some of the most stunning and majestic scenery on the planet. From the Appalachian Mountains out east to the desert terrain of Route 66 out west, the Shipwreck Coast of Michigan and the beaches of Florida, there are essential road trips. Across the United States ByteWheels car rental has a location near you - plan that long awaited trip today!</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Driving across the United States from East to West you'll enjoy several famous road trip destinations. There are ten different states considered to be in the official territory of the Appalachian Mountains, so take your pick on where to go in your <strong>ByteWheels rental car</strong> in the United States. Other notable route options are the Blue Ridge Parkway, far and away one of the most gorgeous routes you can take. Spread throughout North Carolina and Virginia, the length of the route itself is approximately 469 miles, leaving plenty of road to conquer, chances to park and take in everything from the morning mist that hovers over the evergreen forests to afternoon strolls along the many mountain trails.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The granddaddy of all U.S. highways, Route 66 was originally established in 2016, and has since been immortalized in everything from famous songs to television shows. While the highway begins near Chicago, the best parts to travel along Route 66 are in the Southwest U.S., where the desert horizon has never looked so enchanting. After you've picked up the keys to your <strong>rental car</strong>, try taking Route 66 west of Winslow and head toward the famous meteor crater known as the Barringer Crater, where thousands of visitors flock to every year to see the 50,000-year-old meteor crash site. Next, drive further and explore the iconic Mojave Desert near Needles, California, where you can get a taste of what life was like in the wild west.</font></p>
